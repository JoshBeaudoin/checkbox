*For this hoemwork we worked on an assigment that caused problems on your webpage for example stopping something mid action. Mine was a checkbox button that is supposed to give you 1 million dollars if you can click it but with the code we had learned i have made the checkbox unclickable so noone will get the million dollars. 
* I found this one to be more simple than the other ones which is nice but it was just a little bit conusing setting up my code at first because i couldnt get the functions of it to work to make it so people couldnt click the checkbox but after reading over the links tony had left it made it kind of easier to figure out where i was going wrong and eventually got it all right i think/hope haha.
*I learned from doing this project how to write a code that prevents you from doing things the page openly offeres for you to do kind of like a prank but obviously has its benefits for actual webpages.
